# Asteroids
This is a guided project made in Python3. A simple recreation of the classic computer game Asteroids.
I was following the guide provided by Boot.dev in the course "Build Asteroids".

## How to install
To run the game you need to have [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) installed.
Go to the root directory of the project and do:

`python3 main.py`

## Controls
* WASD: Movement (tank controls)
* SPACE: Shoot
